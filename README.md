# Capire-Social-Api

This is a side project I did to learn graphQL and mobile development with React Native. The idea was to make an app that lets users have 
more 1 on 1 interaction with their favorite athletes and influencers. The API manages streams which is the channel of communication between
a user and the influencer.
